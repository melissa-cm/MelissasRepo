    <h1>Melissa Martinez</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> I am an Industrial Engineer with a Masters degree in Social Development Studies; specialised in quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods research.

        With more than three years of experience, I have worked on a range of interdisciplinary research projects with British, North-American and Colombian research agencies and higher education institutions; through which I have gained meaningful knowledge in survey design, validity and reliability, multivariate statistical analysis and quantitiative data processing. In qualitative research, my work has focused on discourse analysis, qualitative coding techniques and focus groups to better understand people's experiences, motivations and insights.</p>
         
        <p>I am intellectually curious, detail-oriented and passionate about qualitative and quantitative data analysis.</p>
    <h2>Life challenges and experiences</h2>
        <p>Some of the worth mentioning challenges I have overcame in the course of my personal and professional life are:   
            <ol>
                <li>Graduating with a distinction as an outstanding Postgraduate student, amidst and in spite of, the Covid-19 Pandemic</li>
                <li>Successfully transitioned from the Engineering disciplines to the social science research</li>
                <li>Moving to a new country for the first time by myself back in 2018, adapting quickly and smoothly to a new culture</li>
            </ol>
